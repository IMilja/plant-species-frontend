# Plant species frontend

This repository contains the backend API built for my (Professional) Master thesis where I developed an application for storing information about different plant species, subspecies, useful parts and etc.

This application is build on top of VueJs with the Vuetify (based on Material Design) library. It communicates with the [Plant Species backend](https://github.com/IMilja/plant-species-backend) to enable full CRUD functionalities and search on the home screen. It also contains a dashboard which can be accessed when a user logins with a email and password combination as well as a forgot password functionality if the user forgets or loses his login credentials.
